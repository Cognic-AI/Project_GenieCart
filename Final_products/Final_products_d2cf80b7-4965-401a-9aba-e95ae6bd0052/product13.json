I do a lot of cooking & cook recipes from all 7 continents!  I learned a long time ago that you NEVER buy olive oil in a plastic container!  This is packaged in a heavy, dark glass bottle & comes from Florence, Italy & is cold-pressed within 4 hours after picking!  The flavor is the best you’ll ever experience!  It might appear to be a little spendy, but when have several hours into a cooking project like velveted, fusion Chinese fried rice only to have it turn out tasting like it’s soured & stale… you’ll be happy you bought this brand of olive oil! I have 3 kids & they hate eating out at a restaurant!  They complain about restaurant quality food and almost always say… “Can’t we just stay home and you make  something that tastes delicious, scrumptious & good? I’ve been cooking for over 30 years & hate to go to restaurants, too!  Gordon Ramsay’s restaurants are the exception! Long story…short, I have what many might consider a kitchen full of expensive equipment! I think that all you need, to get a big jump on your recipes, is a great pan, good ingredients & the Virgeen brand of olive oil! Try it & use it in numerous recipes!  You’ll never even think about the cost when you taste the magic you’ve created!  Good luck & Happy cooking!", "Authentic Premium High Class Extra Virgin Olive Oil I would never think that I could find a real extra virgin olive oil in USA!!! This is premium!!! I am so lucky and so happy that I found it. Growing up with olive oil in the Albanian villages, I am able to distinguish real olive oil from fake ones. I cannot describe the authentic taste this oil has!!! Who has tried the real extra virgin olive oil can feel it what I am saying!!! Amazing, really amazing!!!", "This stuff tasting  great Very tasty Olive oil. Great for cooking or dipping some bread and eating. Comes in a very Nice package . It’s a bit on the pricey side but when you taste it you know where your money was spent.  Smells great,  thickness super smooth and it’s healthy for you how can you go wrong .", "Excellent olive oil! This is my 2nd time purchasing. It has a great taste! I think it's the best tasting olive oil I've had. Definitely recommend!", "Olive oil Excellent, it has a unique flavor, it seems like you are putting the same olives in your mouth, that is the sensation", "Can be given as a gift, well packaged! Top quality, with great benefits from a high polyphenol."]}
