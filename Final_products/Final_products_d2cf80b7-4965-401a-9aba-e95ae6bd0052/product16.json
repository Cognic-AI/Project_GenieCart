I only use high grade olive oil. Atlas Moroccan organic, cold pressed virgin olive oil is the best I have found and I have been looking for years.  Buy a small bottle and take a teaspoon of it straight; savor the flavor.  You will only buy their gallon tins after this.......such a deal for this superior product!  The highest polyphenols of any organic oil you can find.  Support this brand; they are bringing you the best olive oil in the world!  I can't think of any higher complement to give them.", "This is our favorite EVOO we like the taste and health properties. We decided to go up to the 3 liter can to get enough for our uses. The can is wrapped securely in bubble wrap at the factory just like their bottles. The can is not as durable as the thick bottles so it still can be damaged if mistreated by the shipper. The problem is Amazon should have put this in a larger box with padding to protect the ends of the can. Instead they put it in a box the same size as the can so that dropping the box on the end still puts all that shock on the can. My can came in with the top severely dented in on one side. The bubble wrap did nothing to prevent this. Fortunately, it wasn't the spout side or I would not have been able to open it. Luckily, it did not leak. It needs more of a cushion on the inside as shippers throw boxes around a lot more lately.", "This is one of the best olive oil oils I‚Äôve ever used. It has a great flavor. It has a true hint of olive taste if you taste it by itself. We cook everything just about in it. I also use it cold over my vegetables. It comes from Morocco, but it‚Äôs made up in the United States. Morocco is the best place in the world to get all because of the conditions there because the olives to produce the ingredients they need to keep us healthy in our blood vessels and cardiac system. I would definitely recommend it. We are subscribed to it and get a new can every month or two.", "Authentic and superior quality", "Zum Kochen und f√ºr Salate eben", "Atlas, Thank you! I had been purchasing this olive oil for the last few years and recently the product was \"unavailable\" and what an eyeopener for me. This is hands down one of the best and most flavorful olive oils I have ever tried and will try my best to ALWAYS have an extra 3L can set aside, as I do not want to run out of this product and have to substitute again. Please view photo as it is so rich in color, the smell is of a fresh olive orchard and is rich with the tasty very fine sediment of the olives. What a sexy rich color it is and just an all around great quality product. It is a bit pricey, though I enjoy good flavors, food and taste. Dimensions on this 3L container are: 10‚Äù tall x 6‚Äù wide x 3.5‚Äù deep. You will not be let down by this product, try it and you'll be hooked, it's a good thing! Enjoy!"]}
