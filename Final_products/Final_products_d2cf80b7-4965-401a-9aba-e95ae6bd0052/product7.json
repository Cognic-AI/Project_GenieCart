In this Farm, we removed more than 480,000 cubic meters of stones and built one wall by hand, stone by stone, on a length of 6 Kilometers 1.5 meter high and 1 meter deep. In this way we have finally attained the optimal agronomic characteristics required by the olive trees for the best possible olive production.  【 High Polyphenol and First Cold Pressed Extra Virgin Olive Oil 】 Our Olive trees are planted in a harsh rocky desert in Morocco . The significant temperature variations (124°F in summer with extremely cold nights), the rocky soil where the roots struggle to develop along with the scarcity of water puts stress on the olive trees. In the process of protecting themselves, the olive trees produce a high amount of antioxidants . Extremely Healthy Olive Oil in Rich Polyphenols  【 The best chefs in the world prefer Desert Miracle 】 Exclusive Restaurants and luxury hotels, but also high representative institutions and prestigious gourmet stores (as well as award-winning American Chefs) have chosen our extra virgin olive oils. Ten Michelin-starred restaurants use Desert Miracle Oive Oils to create dishes intended for an exclusive, refined and demanding public.  【 Who Are Using Our Extra Virgin Cold Pressed Olive Oils ? 】 Hotel George V in Paris (Michelin Star Restaurant), Embassy of USA in Paris, Jean Marie Amat Restaurant in Bordeaux , Pierre Gagnaire ( Michelin Star Chef ) , Yannick Alleno ( Michelin Star Chef ) , Thierry Marx ( Michelin Star Chef ) , Frédéric Antonr ( Michelin Star Chef ) and more ...  【 Contact Us 】 We would rather lose money than trust that's why you can reach our support agents via Your Amazon Account for problems and questions of any sort.", "price": "21.79", "currency": "$", "product_rating": "4.7", "Color": ["initial"], "availability": true, "shipping": false, "delivery_date": null, "delivery_cost": null, "warranty": false, "warranty_policy": null, "condition": "new", "image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31rictHMg3L._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg", "latest_reviews": ["I purchased two different bottles from the same distributor within two weeks. The first bottle's name was \"Les Terroirs,\" which did not meet my expectations, and the solidification test failed. I tried to return it, but Amazon gave me credit. The second bottle was \"Desert Miracle,\" and it successfully passed the solidification test 100%. The taste and smell were great, and I've attached pictures showing the bottle before and after placing it in the refrigerator for a solidification test.Before consuming the olive oil, the best way to test the purity of olive oil is to pour about 1/4 cup into a clear glass cup and place it in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours, or even overnight. After this time, the olive oil should solidify like butter, which indicates that it is pure olive oil. However, there is no guarantee that it hasn’t been mixed with rancid or old olive oil. NOTE: when you buy Olive oil please do the solidification test.", "Lush, spicy, and warm is the way I'd describe this oil! My new go-to olive oil from now on. Love it. Healthy and flavorful!", "I tested 25 different oils from grocery store, to specialty store to ones on Amazon that are not available locally.  Let me preface this by saying that Olive crops are different every year just as wine grapes and other crops are.  So it’s difficult to think you can always stick to one brand every time you buy it because especially if they are a blend of oils, they may be lovely one year and not so lovely another.However, I can only test what’s in front of me.  This Desert Miracle organic extra virgin olive oil tied for first place with the Atlas brand organic extra virgin olive oil.  What made these different than all the rest?  They actually had the flavor of olives!  Imagine that!  None of the others had an actual olive flavor.  They are both very smooth, flavorful with a slight peppery finish which means they are higher in polyphenols.and neither have any bitterness!!Anyway, this is a supremely amazing olive oil!", "Best olive oil on market. They a have several lines but Desert Miracle is the bomb. 60% more polyphenol than any other olive oil. Major health benefits. 1 tablespoon before bed you will begin to lose weight, you will have softer skin, and actually start feeling better. The polyphenols attack the free radicals in the body that cause the problems. The oil taste great and I use less dressing on salads because I drizzle Desert Miracle on my salads and other stuff. This line is used by most Michelin chefs and most of the top restaurants. Check out the info that is on Amazon they have done a good job in giving you all the info you need to make an informed purchase.", "Good strong olive oil!"]}
