Perfect shipping condition! Perfect taste! I'm using this in my Personal Fitness Training Company for my Healthy Shakes I make for my clients.

It is surprising how much olive oil, even expensive imported olive oil, is a mish mash of different olives from different countries, and sometimes different continents!  This extra virgin olive oil, from Mexico, is excellent.  It is all estate grown and processed with a wonderful flavor and texture.  I use it for everything, even baking!  Fantastic value and quality!", "Perfect weight and great flavor.  It is mild enough to let whatever it is carrying shine through while still letting you know it is there.", "Make sure you have a good grip or this Bad boy can slip right out of your hand"]}
