The price of this stuff has gone sky high.  This is a decent price for 64 oz.  May be getting this regularly.","Great, pure, all natural product. Used it for my all natural homemade skincare products &amp; it worked out perfectly!!!","This is not what I paid for, product comes from India not Italy as they advertise. Now I doubt what oils is really in the bottle. So disappointed","this oil is weird does not taste like olive oil at all."]}
