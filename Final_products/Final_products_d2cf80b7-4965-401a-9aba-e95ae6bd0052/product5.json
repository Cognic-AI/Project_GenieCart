Among these antioxidants are Vitamin A and Vitamin E. Vitamin E partly accounts for the anti-aging benefits of this substance because it helps restore skin elasticity. Several other antioxidants contribute to olive oil benefits for skin. Polyhenols and phytosterols neutralize the free radicals that cause so much skin damage in the human population. One of these antioxidants, Hydroxytyrosol, is a rather rare compound that happens to be plentiful in olive oil. It is one of the key compounds that helps prevent free radical damage. It penetrates deeply into the skin without clogging poresâ€”something a lot of your commercial skin moisturizers due as an unfortunate side effect of their action. Olive oil is different. It moistens skin so thoroughly that it is often used as a home remedy for any type of skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis that creates patches of dry skin. Many women use it for stretch mark therapy after giving birth to a child, and many others use it to treat blemishes that often appear on the skin.", "price": "17.99", "currency": "$", "product_rating": null, "Color": [], "availability": false, "shipping": false, "delivery_date": null, "delivery_cost": null, "warranty": false, "warranty_policy": null, "condition": "new", "image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41dE45NJumL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg", "latest_reviews": []}
