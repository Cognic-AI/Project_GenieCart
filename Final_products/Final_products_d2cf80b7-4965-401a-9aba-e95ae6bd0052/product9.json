Poured and packaged in eye-catching wine bottles, our products set the industry gold standard for taste.", "price": null, "currency": "$", "product_rating": 4.4, "Color": [], "availability": false, "shipping": false, "delivery_date": null, "delivery_cost": null, "warranty": false, "warranty_policy": null, "condition": "new", "image": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31zEMPG20VL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg", "latest_reviews": ["The Olive oil is a good brand but a bit pricey compared to store purchasing. It has a mild flavor and was fresh. The cap was broken but the cork remained in tact so  it was fresh.", "I love this oil while I don't consume it I use it for herbal infusions as its not a pungent olive oil!", "The product itself is good, high-quality olive oil. However, the shipping cost is too expensive, and the marketing is misleading. Many consumers, including myself, might think the olives are grown in California, but the label reveals it's a blend of olives from the Mediterranean. As someone with a marketing background, I find the phrase \"by way of the Mediterranean\" rather vague and confusing.\n\nNevertheless, it's a good product if you don't mind whether the olives are imported or locally grown in California.", "Love this olive oil. Has a very good taste and i love the bottle ðŸ˜Š", "The vendor had some problems in the delivery but made a big effort to solve it and compensate. I want to thank you for it. The product is excellent.", "Misleading brand name suggests product is from Napa Valley.  Surprise! Small print on label reveals otherwise.  A true \"Gotcha!\""]}
