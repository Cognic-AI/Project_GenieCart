I missed the basic smooth, red sauce that I could season to my taste.Classico is perfect. This is my first time using it  and my sauce turned out so yummy....ALMOST as good as my Nonna's scratch sauce.Classico has a deep red color, smells great, and, most importantly, is smooth. (No respectable Italian wants big chunks of tomato in her red sauce) Make sure the label reads, \"Classico Family Favorites Traditional Pasta Sauce.\" (I cannot find this variety at my local grocery stores.)Classico will be my go-to sauce from now on. It's priced lower than most jar sauces and the quality is better. I also tried their pizza sauce recently and loved it.Why did I wait so long to try Classico??\n"}, {"reviewTitle": "IT'S CLASSICO - ALWAYS GREAT", "rating": 5, "reviewBody": "I used to cater Italian meals, so I am familiar with many different sauces.  Classico is one I really like, because I can tweak it however I want, or use straight on french bread, crusty rolls or pizza dough to make a great treat.  Quality is always there. It IS a bottled sauce, so not the same as starting from scratch (for us puritans), but it is just plain handy for when I don't have several hours to put something together."}, {"reviewTitle": "Great buy, great taste!", "rating": 5, "reviewBody": "It's getting difficult finding the \"plain\" one in the stores so I am VERY happy to get these from Amazon.
