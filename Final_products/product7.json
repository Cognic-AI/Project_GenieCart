Arnold", "rating": "5.0", "review": "The paper was delivered quickly, overnight, which was important because we needed some A4 paper that fast. The product itself is top drawer, to be sure. But the price was really high. Forty pieces of paper for ten bucks is just too much. Yeah, I get it, imported from Thailand, where the labour is cheap, pennies on the dollar compared to America...and the import taxes and all that junk. I suppose the fact that we needed it \"right now\" can be seen as justifying the price for overnight free delivery.\n\nAgain, great product, good print quality (I have a little HP 1020 laser printer) and satisfied with the results."}, {"reviewer": "NancyDrew", "rating": "5.0", "review": "I purchased a certificate for a British Lord as a gag gift for af fiend last Christmas.  After the purchase on Groupon, I had to print out the certificate.  However it would not fit on regular 8.5 x 11 paper.  It turned out that the certificate was set for the European 8 x 11.5 ( I may be slightly off here) as I’m going from memory).  I didn’t like how it looked if I reduced it so I bought this JUST for the certificate.  But I did learn that mot of the world uses this A4 size paper while the US does not.  Well who knew???  Lol"}, {"reviewer": "Andrew R", "rating": "5.0", "review": "Excellent paper if you are searching for A4, but very pricey for such a small amount.
