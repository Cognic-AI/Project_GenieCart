I use it to make notebooks.Sadly at least a 3rd of a ream is unusable for presentation. (Like giving to people) Its fine for scrap paper to write on. The top and bottom reams had damaged papers. The pages were bent rather hard due to the box bending. And some were dirty since the box tore and the dirt got to a good amount of papers.The reams' individual packaging also fell apart as I took them from the box.Like overall I won't return it since most of it is usable and itd be hard to put it back anyway. I was happy to find some form of A4 paper here in the United States.Oh right, the papers branding also looked different than whats shown in the picture, but I can't remember what it was since I have thrown out the packaging."}]}
