Super cute and perfect. I drink alot of lemon ice water daily and this is bottle is great. Big enough to drop ice in but not too big!", "After using this bottle on a daily basis since I purchased it 4 months ago, the flower decals are peeling off.  I had another bottle that was exactly the same as this one which I used for over 1 year and this did not happen to the first bottle.  While the functionality of the bottle is still 100%, I picked this one over other brands and styles because I loved the beauty of the red flowers.  It is disappointing to see them coming off.", "I’m quite happy with this purchase and love the red poppy design. I use it to have my reverse osmosis water in the upstairs bathroom.  (Via a kitchen tap.)  As larger glass bottles are too heavy to carry when going outside walking, etc.  And too big to safely sit in your car holder.", "The protective sleeve does a good job keeping cold and warmth away from your hands. Thickness is great. Downside is that it leaks from the lid. Can't tip it or have it on its side or the liquid will leak from the lid. I have this type of bottle from another company and looks exactly the same which I loved but I broke it so I was looking for a replacement and found this one. It's double the price which I didn't mind but yeah, not functional. I had to remove the rubber/plastic piece from my other broken bottle and put it in this one for it to stop leaking.", "Good size . easy to handle also easy to wash. Very pretty.lots people liked my water bottle, and when I told them the store about the bottle, everyone loved it more. Thank you and keep up the good work.Galia .", "Pros:Glass = healthy.Nice design.The print on the bottle (to some extend) protects water from the sun.Cons:1. the opening is too wide (for me). It's more like a tall glass than a bottle.2. the fabric cover is not sewed well, ripped off at the handle after few uses. But you can perfectly use the bottle without the cover.", "I had this for less than a month and had chipped where the lid screws on. It also leaks during travel. I reached out to company and they sent a replacement free of charge."]}
