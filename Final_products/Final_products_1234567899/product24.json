Keeps my drinks cold and doesn't leak. For everything you get it's a great value. They give you a strawbrush so everything is super easy to clean.", "love that it has the handle as i used it for work, & it kept my water cold in summer days.", "kept my water cold for hours and its super sturdy, does not spill. Very easy to clean and love the different tops it has. The straw Is easy to suck water out of. Love it so much my new favorite water bottle.", "Love the wide mouth. Easy to insert ice. Keeps things cold for quite awhile. Paint peels off if bumped against rough surface. Didn't see any leakage. Definitely worth the money. Love the color.", "I know this is supposed to be for kids but I’m an adult and I bought it for myself. I think it’s great! I love the colors on it, my favorites. The mouth is large enough that I can get ice in it without a struggle. I’m amazed that it keeps my water cold all day, it doesn’t seem to be thick or heavy enough to be like a real thermal item but yet it works. I didn’t want anything larger, I have carpal tunnel and can’t handle anything really heavy. For me it’s just perfect.", "Great item keeps cold along time", "I am impressed.  The color is uniform throughout.  It is sturdy and will withstand my gym time.  Would buy again.", "This is a great insulated bottle. I use it daily and it keeps the water with some ice very cold, that makes me drink more refreshing water each day.", "J'adore cette bouteille. Le principe avec la paille  facilite pour boire en voiture. Ça nous garde les yeux sur la route. Garde froid pendant plusieurs heures.", "Keeps liquid cold for at least 12hrs under the sun, ice cubes did not melt.", "It's a great bottle to keep water cool in the summer while walking outdoor. I also like the fading colour and it looks so cool.", "Great bottle to carry around and keep me hydrated at work. Great color", "8yr old loves it keeps the ice all day at school, durable easy to clean"]}
