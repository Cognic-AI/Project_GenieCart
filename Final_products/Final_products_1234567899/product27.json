I bought it for work to keep with me cause I got tired of my water getting warm during the hot days. The 32 OZ is the perfect size. Not bulky and inconvenient to carry around but not so small that it's gone in 2 drinks. I drink 1 bottle before lunch and 1 after lunch.The insulation is great and keeps my water cold through those hot days for many hours. As far as keeping stuff warm I'm not sure. I haven't tried.Very sturdy buld, feels pretty solid and doesn't leak.Overall great water bottle for daily use. Has nice paint coat of it with very small amount of texture making it very easy to carry around.", "perfect fit for backpacks and on the gokeeps drinks very cold all day", "This works well but doesn’t keep ice super long.", "There was a pice missing The advertised lanyard", "2 for $17 good deal.  So far so good.  kids love it for school, keep water hot or cold.", "I love this water bottle. I’ll put ice in it that has been filtered and I’ll put in my Burpee water and it stays ice cold all night long at my bedside. I have it by me all day long and I take it with me when I go places. It’s steel interior which cleans easily and keeps the water very cold for me.I love it, and I would order it again. The flip up mouthpiece is wide to be able to drink more water at a time and it is easily cleaned.", "THE BOTTLE ASTARTS LICKING AFTER 3 USES WASTE OF MONEY", "My son loves this bottle. It has a wide mouth so it's easy to add ice and eases in cleaning too. It also comes with 2 different lods so you can choose what you want to use. It is leak proof and is a solid build. It's not heavy either so easy to carry around.", "Looks cool, keeps the water cool and has a large capacity.  Arrived much quicker than advised.  Only difficulty has been getting used to a bottle with an open top. I find the plastic top bottle easier when in the gym.", "I just received my new water bottle and I love it!  The quality is excellent - well made, nice finish - and I like the option of straw or sip top.  This is to replace my Lululemon water bottle that I lost overboard while sailing this summer.  And this one is just as well made but half the price!  So happy with this purchase!", "This little bottle is great.  No leaks and it keeps water cold for at least 24 hours.  I haven't used it for anything hot yet. It fits perfectly into my console in the car.  I also like the easy carry handle", "Keeps inside the temp you want"]}
