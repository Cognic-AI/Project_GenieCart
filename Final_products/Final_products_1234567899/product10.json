Took me some time to find a thermos to replace the one I had but I finally decided on this one. I love the size. Quality , ease of cleaning inside and drinking piece on top. I use the wide drinking top rather than the straw. Works great. Very easy to unscrew and flip up to drink from. Keeps water cold all day. Ice does melt down during the day but after an 8 hr day there still ice pieces. The carrying loop attached to the top is very handy. A must for me because my arms are always full. This thermos fits nicely in the cupHolders in my car. Super happy with my purchase. Water tastes pure drinking from the thermos.", "We have 3 of these now, 22 oz and 14 oz.  We use them daily with the chug lid for keeping our water cold, and occasionally for coffee.  For the grandkids we use the straw lid.  Completely dishwasher safe and leakproof, nice-looking, the handles are convenient, and fits well in our car cupholders.  Great at holding the right temperature.  Perfect.", "I bought this bottle before leaving on a trip to Japan. I wanted something I could take on the plane because I get dehydrated flaying. It was easy to fill at the airport water stations, stayed cold for over 14 hours. I drank from the lid rather than the straw attachment. It was easy to carry on the side of my day pack throughout the trip. Pretty blue color.", "I purchased one for each of my three boys (ages 6 and 9), and the 22oz is the perfect size for them. It's durable enough for school, keeps their water cold all day, and has great color choices. Also, it has two options for drinking, wide mouth or spout with straw - definitely helpful for younger kiddos.", "This is my every day water bottle. It keeps my ice and water all day.", "This was the 2nd bottle I had purchased in a week. This bottle keeps my ice frozen overnight and longer. I like both the kids. Well worth the money.", "Purchased this for my trip to Greece. It was the perfect size. Kept my water cold and it fit perfectly in my back pack pocket.", "We are very pleased with these water bottles! We were looking for something that would be easy to take care of, and these bottles are completely dishwasher safe (including the lids). There hasn’t been any cracking/chipping/pealing of the powder coat color, even with dishwashing them every night. The chug lid is also great! It has a large loop handle that makes carrying the water bottle along with many other things at the same time very easy to do. And as a small bonus, we found that the cleaning brushes that came with the water bottles are also very nice quality. All-in-all: 5 stars. Would buy again!", "En la foto se veía más pequeña pero está bien porque cabe casi un litro en esta , trae dos tipos de tapas por si quiero cambiar ,trae su agarradera muy práctica , mantiene los líquidos dentro sin derrame y según sea caliente o fría es el tiempo , lo q me gusta es q tiene boca ancha para lavarla fácil y llegar a todos lados y poder echarle frappe casi sólido o hielos .las paredes se ven de buen espesor casi parece un pequeño tanque por lo solida q es muy buena si quieres q dure .", "This works well and keeps drinks cold.Good selection of colors"]}
