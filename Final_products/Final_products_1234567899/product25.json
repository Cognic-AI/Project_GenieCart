AndB- I was amazed how cold this actually keeps drinks and got me wondering if it would stay that way.Short review - does what's advertised, great build quality, nice to have different options on accessories. You like cold drinks buy this.Small complaint is they only have certain colors and certain times, would be nice to pick from any of their colors when you order. Don't know why but small gripe.First this bottle is amazing. I'm one who likes to keep ice cold water by me at all times. And this does the job!So what started my waiting to review the bottle, was one day in August 100° + weather outside, I left this bottle in my truck on the passenger seat (in direct sunlight) and forgot about until lunch. I come back into the truck and this bottle is hot to the touch. But still, ice cold water in there.So then I thought, well let's test out how long this keeps it cold. Filled it to the top with ice, then water and just left it sitting in my house. By the time 3 days came around I checked and there was little to no ice, but it stayed colder than room temperature.I fill this up ever night with a whole tray of ice before bed. I drink it through out the night, refill the water in the morning and through out the day and it usually has some ice left in it by night time. My family loves it.I ending up having to buy my girlfriend one (32oz), which we lost on a trip, so I purchased another one recently to replace it. It's that good!Wear and tear, it's surprisingly durable. My kids drag and drop it, I use it work (construction) it rolls around all over my car because I don't have a place to put it, but you'd never know it was taking the beating it has.Easy to clean and wash. No rust or anything.So the lids I feel are definitely gonna be a preference. Lucky they're inexpensive so I'd suggest buying the sports top as well just to try them both.Regular screw on handle lid keeps it real right and leak proof, but when your drinking the last bit of water sometimes the ice comes crashing down and splashes water all over you.The sports top is easy, and more convenient (especially for children) but I have 2 complaints, I feel like it doesn't keep the water cold as long as the screw on type (not bad but to seemed ice was melting slightly faster...just a bit) and the thing squeaks, they tell you how to fix it (poke the black thingy with a pen or something) but when I did it didn't help. So I poked a little harder and the thing fell out. So now if the bottle is on its side, it leaks out the hole. We have a second lid, so problem solved, but it was just unfortunate. The sports top also comes with straws and cleaners for them. My girlfriend uses it she likes it, I prefer no straw and just tipping the bottle in the air. Ether way it works.Over all I was very happy. Enough to buy 2 more later on and I just recently bought there Coldest Pillow so I'll see how that turns out.It does what it's advertised, holds up well and they're really at a reasonable price for the quality that goes into it.One more thing I tested it just one day with ice and Dr. Pepper. It kept it cold and carbonated most of the day. I had the big handle cap on. Only did it once, but it did hold the carbonation.The pictures I put were to show how little damage this bottle has received over a whole year of abuse/washing. Honestly this thing is durable.", "It is the best bottle that keeps water cold for the longest time. Must have item for hiking.", "The Coldest Water Bottle: I do love this water bottle! All my other ones are obsolete now. I've had it for nearly three weeks and use it constantly. The 2nd day I had it, I was surprised to find the ice had not melted after it sat on the kitchen counter from the previous day. On the 3rd day, I had left the cap off intentionally the night before to melt the ice so I could wash it out. Much to my surprise, the cold just settled in the bottom of the bottle and the ice was still unmelted. I don't know how it's done but this little gem is ridiculously good at keeping some reserve ice so you can refill the bottle again and again for almost two days. The trick is to fill it with ice no more than half way so you have plenty of water before it's time to refill. Bottom line is I took a $20 gamble and it paid off beautifully. You'll be drinking ice cold water all the time too! It's worth it.PROS: Managed correctly, it will maintain enough ice to chill water for close to two days. It has a rugged powder coat finish. This bottle is very durable. The lid handle is very solid and secure.CONS: The Coldest Water Bottle is not huge by any means. You'll have to refill it often but the reserve ice will chill your water instantly. The black finish might cause more rapid ice melt in direct hot sun but I did leave it in my hot car for six hours while fishing - came back and it still had plenty of ice. You have to unscrew the cap each time for a drink but it is very secure with a silicone gasket. This bottle won't leak when it's on it's side. It's durability might be offset by it's weight which is a little heavy for long treks. I wish the drink through lid(sold separately) will become available soon on Amazon. The best improvement to be made to this bottle is to attach a rubber boot on the bottom. The thin powder coat finish is evident when you set the bottle on a hard surface from the metallic \"ping\" noise it makes. Won't be long though before I find something rubberized to fit snug around the bottom.", "Purchased this for my husband for his coffee he takes to work. He loves it! His coffee stays hot for his 10+ hour shift. Does not leak at all.  Fantastic design engineering and perfect size for travel too. Very durable. Fun red color. Thank you!", "Nice bottle that keeps water cold for a long time.", "Los hielos de mi termo siguen despues de 24 horas , recomiendo el producto ampliamente", "este de verdad es un Termo, le puse 4 cubitos de hielo y agua y tiene 46 horas el agua helada!Cuidado con las imitaciones que hay por ahi, parecen a menor precio...", "We bought this water bottle in June.  My husband was going to use it for work but didn't like how hard it was to drink thru the straw. My daughter used it a hand full of times in June and this summer.  We went to use it again and while we were putting the lid back on it came apart with no way to fix it. We did like how it kept her water cold all day at school but now we cant use it.", "Horticultrice et l’eau est encore froide après 8heures en pleins soleil. Je l’a recommande!"]}
