Absolutely love the paracord handle, it makes it much more comfortable to carry around when it’s full and heavy. You don’t get the funky taste you get from plastic bottles which is a huge plus! Everything about it feels high quality and durable, I have no fear whatsoever that it’ll just bust at random like the cheaper plastic jugs. It also keeps cold water cold for a decent amount of time. The straw is still plastic like most jugs out there, but I’ve been using it for about 6 months and haven’t noticed any weird tastes or smells. Just wash everything really well routinely and it should be completely fine. Definitely recommend this jug and will probably buy the smaller one in the future for travel!", "I've had several similar water bottles and there are several features I like about this one.1) On prior bottles, when opening the drink spout after the beverage may have warmed slightly, the pressure created causes the beverage to shoot out of the spout. THIS bottle vents as you are opening the spout, an awesome point especially when drinking beverages that will stain your clothes!2) The carrying strap. There are two straps you can use on this bottle. The one on the lid with the drink spout works well and unlike most of the others I've had. On other bottles I've had, using this carrying strap with a full container causes the lid to pop off and make a mess. THIS bottle's lid is secure and doesn't have that issue.3) The paracord handle that tightens around the neck of the bottle is another very sturdy option to carry the bottle.4) The water bottle cleaning kit that comes with this is very useful in keeping all components of the bottle clean.5) The sleeve included with the bottle is a nice addition to negate the clanging of the metal bottle and insulate the contents.A great buy and should something happen to this one I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another.", "I had to send return the first bottle for a replacement because of a defect but new one kept my water cold for over 8 hours when it was over 100°. I also like that it came with a straw and bottle brush for cleaning.If yours doesn't maintain the temperature and you hear what sounds like escaping air when you use the straw it's likely that there is a pinhole in the inner chamber.My replacement was sent right away and hassle free. Good customer service.", "I was going to purchase a Stanley for way more and then I seen this beauty.  Perfect for my needs.  It comes with all the cleaning products, carry bag, little compass on it, a carry handle and most importantly it does not leak! Leak proof! Keeps my ice water cold for hours.  The straw is long and reaches towards the bottom of the mug.  I like the ombré colors as well. Very good stainless steel mug!  Love it", "Definitely worth the money. I use this almost every day, it keeps my ice fresh for over 24 hours even sitting in my car during the day (night shifter). I love the carry case, it's convenient to carry the bottle. It does not leak at all, it came with 2 straws which I appreciate being able to have a back up. Overall it's great quality and i love that it comes with all the brushes needed to clean. Definitely getting one for my husband!", "Although the ice doesn't last, it keeps cold items cold. Also very easy to transport.", "I love this water bottle. I bought one for my nephew as well. It's made well and has several carry options because of straps. Cleans easy. The only draw back is it's heavy because of the size. I am very happy with this purchase.", "Good quality water bottle. Durable, easy to carry, comes with cleaning brush, extra straw and two lids. Little on heavy side.", "So far this bottle is perfect! Easy to clean, love the colour (sky blue/navy) and I like the pebbled exterior as it makes it easier to grip. The option of lids is nice but as mentioned in other reviews, it came with one straw that doesn’t seem to fit anywhere and there are no directions. The rubber smell others mentioned is from the strap and after a wash that is already dissipating (a little lemon EO also helped). Keeps my water nice and cold, no leaks and great price point…. Can’t go wrong honestly. No issues with delivery.", "I love this water bottle. It looks nice and does keep the liquid cold for 24 hours. It very durable and it’s big enough for the whole day.", "Love it! Keeps my water cold for a few days", "eau froide."]}
