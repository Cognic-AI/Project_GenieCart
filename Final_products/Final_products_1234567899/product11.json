The ice stays cold and frozen for a long time. The price i paid for this and the amount that we got was greater! It even came with an extra straw! No complaints so far. We love love love this bottle ‚ù§‚ù§.He says he can't wait to get some stickers for it!", "I am thoroughly impressed. It's more money than I usually like spending but I'm very glad I did it, 100% worth it. When I opened the package of this water bottle, it came with two lids, one for hot liquid and one for cold. It also came with a cleaning brush that extends so you can thoroughly clean the inside, and it came with an extra straw just in case the one already inside the bottle gives out. The water bottle is durable and scratch resistant, capable of holding a full gallon of water, and when full, it's not overly heavy compared to similar containers. I only use this to hold water, so I haven't tested its ability to hold temperatures.", "Like the choice of tops. Like that it comes with a cleaner. Great color and quality for the money. I have dropped it sereral times with no damage, so it is durable.For myself, I  have small hands. I bought the 40 oz. bottle. It is too wide for my hand, and when full slides out of my fingers. I need to be sure to hold it by the top. It is not easy to hold if your hands are small. Go for the lesser ounces, that is what I would  do next time.", "I've been using stainless steel sports water bottles for 20 years and I'm mostly a water drinker (except when I'm at a party drinking I like to make my own drinks with good liquor and a sports water bottle like this is perfect and you don't have to get a new drink every 10 minutes). But I mostly use these when I'm at home... it's literally the only thing I drink out of... and this is by far the best one I've ever had. Even though I've liked my other ones they all would leak if I took it in a back pack or something, but this one doesn't leak at all.And I wouldn't expect it, but this includes every possible accessory one could want as well. 3 different lids (one geared to something in the realm of coffee), 2 straws etc. And even a cleaning wand that can reach down and clean the inside, which for whatever reason I had never thought of getting something to clean the inside before. I would every once in a while boil water and pour it inside and and even pour hydrogen peroxide and shake it up and clean what I could that way.... but it's more convenient to have something to clean the inside and I just had never thought of getting anything specifically for cleaning my water bottle.This is an impressive water bottle for a good price. Whoever makes it/sells it really went above and beyond with the extras as well.", "A friend suggested me this bottle and I gotta say I was blown away. This keep my water cold for HOURS, now if you add ice to it your drink will be cool for a couple days. Great product, delivery was quick. It comes with different lids. 10/10", "I use it daily at home and at the gym and love that I have a choice of lids.", "Very good buy big bottle sturdy nice colours and keeps your beverage cold or hot. I would buy again.", "Se lo regale a mi esposo de D√≠a del padre y lo ha disfrutado much√≠simo este verano, se lleva su agua fr√≠a al trabajo y le aguanta muy bien. Me encanto que viene con su propia esponja para lavarlo.", "I use this for the gym.  I like that it fits in our vehicle‚Äôs smallish cup holders because I drink most of my water on the way home.  I don‚Äôt like twist tops on water bottles because I‚Äôm driving and this has a nice pop up top.  I drink room temperature liquids but if I did use ice I‚Äôm sure it would keep the water cold. No leaks either.", "Keeps water really cold, and amazing design", "Things a tank.Like the two different caps and the size is really good.Wanted a BIG one and this is it."]}
