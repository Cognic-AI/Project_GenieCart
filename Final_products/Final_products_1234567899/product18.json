The bottles are well made and they are sturdy. I appreciate the fact that the cap is easy to clean properly. Some of these type of bottles aren't easy to clean and tend to accumulate germs and mold. They're great.", "The bottle is great but the tip was tinted yellow when it arrived", "Loved it for the first few months. But I recently used it and I felt small plastic pieces coming out on the top of the cap while I was drinking from it. Extremely low quality water bottle. I also never used it for hot beverages, or even cold beverages. Just room-temp water. Honestly, I'd avoid this product."]}
