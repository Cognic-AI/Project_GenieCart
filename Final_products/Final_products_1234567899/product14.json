The dual-purpose FreeSip spout is geniusâ€”it lets you sip from a straw or tilt to drink straight from the bottle, which makes it super versatile for any situation. The insulation works perfectly, keeping my water cold for hours, even on hot days, which I love!The twist cap is secure and easy to open, and I feel great knowing itâ€™s BPA-free. The stainless steel is durable yet lightweight, and it doesnâ€™t dent easily, even when Iâ€™m on the go. Itâ€™s the ideal water bottle for anyone who wants a high-quality, convenient, and stylish hydration solution.", "This is a great water bottle! I havenâ€™t had any issues with leakage so far. I love that it offers two ways to drink: through the removable straw or directly from the rim. Itâ€™s also easy to take apart for cleaning, which is a big plus. The durability seems solid, and I got the white version, which is super cuteâ€”I love the color scheme!Itâ€™s slim and lightweight, making it easy to carry. It fits perfectly in my carâ€™s cup holder and easily squeezes into my carry-on or mini backpack. Overall, Iâ€™m really happy with my purchase!", "This water bottle by Owala is a Freesip Twist.It holds 24 Oz of liquid. It is very durable and very nice looking.Comes with a variety of colors suitable for anyone who wants a nice pop of color to them.Owala cups/tumblers actually hold ice inside them for 48 hours. Not, 24.An exact proof testing is when there was a power outage in my area for more than a week due to a natural disaster I had a small generator and an ice maker attached to each other to have cold drinks and it well kept things cold for 48 hours. The Owala cup was on the table with ice and it was well kept cold drinks for 48 hours which is super cool.This free sip is designed for like going to a gym or doing some workout activity.It has a little cord that you can hold it from It is compatible with backpacks to be held on the side or placed inside a bag or backpack. This bottle has the 2-way technology. One side for chugging and another one with a hidden straw for sipping.All in all, this is a nice bottle for various hand sizes.It is very durable, easy to drink from and has a fun surprise after you twist off the cap to show you it has the same two-way sip style technology as the other style bottle.strongly recommend Owala to anyone who wants a pop of color on each one, keep your drinks cold for up to two days worth and they are easy to clean. Fun for the whole family.", "This water bottle is such a great item! It keep water cold for like ever, has the coolest lid and comes in great colors. You can sip it with the straw or chug it. The lid has both built in so itâ€™s super easy to use. Cleaning is a breeze too.", "uh to start off it came in a bag like?? and it had scratches on the bottom and also it was wet from the inside like who ever sold this bottle to me just finished their water and put it in a bag and sent it off literally was wet inside and reeked also the mouth part was gross cuz it was wet too but overall with a good clean it was fine cute bottle really nice better than the original i will say i love it but i dont recommend getting it used tbh but its mad cute xoxo!!ðŸ’— anyways the color is soo cute and the size is great its slim and small and great for school and for putting on the side of a backpack im going into highschool with this and im happy with it although i love the original owala but its kind of big and weighs my bag down to the side so i wanted a slim one and this is amazing!! i love owala pls sponser meðŸ˜¢ðŸ’—ðŸ’—", "the slim size of the owala twist fits into all cup holders and looks sleek & clean. like all owalas she doesnâ€™t leak, keeps water chilly, and has the funnest straw mechanism. love the flexible handle. constantly refilling her because sheâ€™s only 24oz, but would recommend this bottle thousand times over!", "Finally, a water bottle that really fits in my cars cupholder.  Before this arrived, I purchase FOUR different brands that claimed to fit in a car holder, none of which did.  We have a 2024 Chrysler and they were all just a tad too big and I was determined to find one.  The funny thing is, we have several Owala bottles, but they're the FreeSip original design (which does not fit in my car holder) and I didn't think to search the brand.  Finally in a last effort to find one, I searched Owala and landed on this gem.  I didn't realize they had so many new styles.The bottle has the same sip and chug feature that the original FreeSip has, the only different is the neck is a bit smaller and the cap screws on which I honestly like more.  I also love the little cord handle on the cap.  The bottle is perfect and although the neck is a bit smaller than the FreeSip design, it's still easy to load with ice.  My search is over, and I'm thrilled with mine.", "I have a ton of water bottles, but Owalaâ€™s are becoming my favorite. This design still has the functionality of a straw or you can use the spout. Itâ€™s easy to put ice in also water from the fridge. It keeps it cold for quite a few hours, and I love the black and green color. This is so easy to carry and fit in the cupholders in my car. It open so easily."]}
