It holds 24 ounces and if refilled once during the day you can be sure to drink at least 48 ounces! I keep one of these in my fridge so I have a full one to take when I go out.  The sturdy strap makes it easy to carry.  I appreciate that it doesn't have a straw that needs frequent cleaning.  The screw top makes it excellent for drinking.", "My biggest issue with water bottles is that when they go up in price, they end up having features that are too complicated.  Meaning that they become more difficult to clean.  Hinges, crevices, spouts, etc....  they all have areas that are hard to reach with a sponge, and can even be difficult to get to with a special brush.  Those areas start to gather bacteria and inevitable start to smell.  This bottle has none of those and because of that it's perfect!  Being that it is a wide mouth I thought it would spill easily.  Nope.  It has a mesh filter that slows down the flow to a comfortable drinking pace.  All parts come apart easily for thorough cleaning, and fit back together just as easily.  The material used for the body of the bottle is solid.  Highly recommended.", "It’s pretty good, works as expected. Some people say they have trouble with it leaking but I’m not experiencing any of that. When you use it you gotta make sure you put the lid on right though or else it might leak but it’s really easy.", "Very durable and i like how it has a gaurd so you won't get the ice in your face. Doest leak and is easy to clean.", "Love that it has a smaller filtered spout for drinking, and a larger one for filling. The handle definitely comes in handy. Great price.", "No matter what you do, how tight or loose you assemble it the bottle will not seal so it just constantly leaks out through the threading.", "I use it mostly at night, and barely use plastic bottled anymore. Very happy with my purchase.", "Bought for my son for school! Doesn't leak! && he loves it!", "I love this water bottle.  Now Ice doesn’t hit my lip.  I can add fruit or other things to my water and I don’t have to sort it with my teeth.  Great product", "メモリがOZなんが日本ではどうなのかな？800ｍｌって書いてますがギリ入らないま、どーでも良いですが（笑）内蓋にメッシュが付いているのでティーバッグを入れたまま飲めるのでそれは便利", "DudableThick plasticLove the simplicity of ifLightweightSon loves otr", "保冷は出来ませんが、なかなか水筒を飲むことが出来ない息子に、飲んだ量が見えやすく、また時間と照らし合わせて飲むことで、学校での脱水を防ぐという目的で購入したので満足です。購入してから気づきましたが、茶こしのパーツが付いているので、茶葉をそのまま入れても飲めます。", "no complaints. still getting used to it"]}
