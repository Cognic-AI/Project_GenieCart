It fits my hand, it fits my bike water bottle cage, it fits my car's drink holders, it fits my my day pack and it \"holds my beer!\" The \"chug lid\" works really well. It opens with the push of a button and closes with a click. It seals well, no leaks; however, you need to make sure that the silicone rubber ring gask for the top seal doesn't fall out when you drop the lid.The bottle keeps an iced drink cold for a day.if you precool it. The 20 oz size is perfect for whatever libation you want to keep cool. I got a smoke'n deal on the aqua green one, so I bought two. I don't need a fancy color and the blue-green one. You can't buy a plastic bike bottle that doesn't keep liquids cold for $10. Good value for the money.Finally, the bottle is really rugged. I've been riding my bike, had the bottle fall out, hit the ground, and skid and roll with no damge.", "I am a fanatical bike rider.  Currently, I ride 40-50 miles per day (mid-summer) in Florida, so having something cold to drink is mandatory.  I have gone through 3-4 other brands of insulated bottles, including the biggest one in insulated bottles.  Nothing is better than this one.I bought the Fanhaw 20 oz. size because it fits best in my bottle cages.  It is the most compact 20 oz. insulated bottle I have owned.  In spite of its compact size, it keeps my water as cold or colder than any other bottle I have used.I load the bottle with ice cubes and then add water to top off.  I carry a refill bottle of water to refill my Fanhaw 2-3 times per ride.  I have never run out of ice in the bottle.  Cold to start, cold to end.It has a carry handle that snaps flush to the bottle when not needed.  It has a pop-up lid.  It has a drinking spout, and a breathe hole so the water flows freely.  It is well made and attractive.  It is very competitively priced.One tip for something I had to learn.  I tend to drink from the bottle sideways (the popup lid to the side).  That doesn't work with this bottle.  The breathe hole needs to be above the spout for it to work effectively, and then it works very well.Bottom line, I have purchased two and will likely purchase again.", "I bought two of these mainly for my bike rides.  I had to replace my aging Contigo water bottles b/c the handles are breaking and to replace them with another Contigo brand is too expensive.  I also wanted a bottle that you could use with one hand to open it which is important when riding a bike.  And lastly, I wanted a 20oz bottle as I do not have enough room in my bike's water bottle cage to fit a 24oz bottle (it hits the bike frame).  It seems most bottles nowadays are 24oz or more.This Fanhaw bottle had the features I wanted.  It seems to keep liquids cold for a decent amount of time.  The handle feels a bit flimsy so we will see how it holds up.  I like the size as it is a smaller footprint than my Contigo 20 oz bottles (about an inch shorter).  In fact, I had to measure both b/c I did not think the Fanhaw would hold as much.  Sure enough, 20oz.  It also does not leak.  Yay!The only minor issue is how the lid opens.  It flips up and as you drink from the bottle but only goes back so far.  So, the lid is right between your eyes and hits the forehead which limits how much you can tilt the bottle.  You have to tilt your entire head back a bit to drink especially as you get near empty.  It's minor and I can still see enough when riding my bike, but I do wish it opened more and was out of the way.  Oh, and you cannot turn it sideways to prevent getting hit between the eyes as it has a vent hole which if the bottle is turned sideways, contents will leak from the hole.  I wish they allowed the cap to swing open further.On the plus side, washing the bottle is easy.  The Contigo bottles have springs and stuff in the bottle top and a small spout that opens which can be a pain to clean.  We only use our bottles for water so it is not a big deal.  This Fanhaw bottle just has a regular hole-type opening and some rubber or silicone seals.  Very easy to clean.For the price, it does what my Contigo bottles do though just not as well (the Contigo bottles did not have flipping type lid, just a push button that opened a spout).  If they could improve the amount the lid opens so it swings back further, they would have a near perfect bottle, at least for my needs.  I noticed while writing this review that there is a tab that stops the lid from opening further.  I suspect that through repeated use of the top flipping open and relying on this small tab to stop its momentum, it will ultimately break and the top will flip all the way open and no longer hit the forehead.  So, it may be a rare case where something breaks and it improves the product:)UPDATE:  I noticed after my review above that you can push the lid open further so it does not hit you in the forehead.  The tab is just an initial stop position.  Although when fully open it still obstructs your view if riding a bike, you do not need to tilt your head back as far.Another UPDATE:  It has since occured to me that my comparison to the Contigo water bottle is not a great comparison.  Yes, the Fanhaw is cheaper than the Contigo, but as my wife pointed out, we have dropped our Contigo water bottles numerous times over the years (even while riding our bikes and hence they fell to the pavement at 15mph) and they have held up well.  I doubt the Fanhaw water bottle will survive a single fall to the concrete as the lid is a cheap plastic unlike the durable materials used on the Contigo bottles.  I will try my best not to drop it but as much as we use them, it is bound to happen.", "Title: Exceptional Fanhaw 20 Oz Water Bottle - A Family Favorite!I recently acquired the Fanhaw 20 Oz Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle in the striking Green Blue shade, and it has truly exceeded all expectations.
