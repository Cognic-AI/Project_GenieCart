Easily keeps ice and my water  12+ hours.  I liked the first one so much I bought a second one", "Keeps ice for a long time. Doesn’t grow mold on plastic seal easily like some others I have had. I like the handle on top carry", "Be sure to screw the cap on tight. It helps keep the drink colder longer.", "Great quality and durability", "Unfortunately, I purchased this product due to the many positive reviews, however, after less than a week usage, I have to return because it does leak.", "Keeps water cold, great size and durable", "Bought this for my husband to take back and forth to work with him. I put ice water in it and when he came home from  a 13 hour shift there was still ice inside.", "Aunq me pareció caro cumple su propósito", "It keeps my drinks cold or hot for hours. The wide mouth is great for adding ice, and the leak-proof design is super handy. Highly recommend!!", "This is a rugged bottle, great looking, easy to grasp, holds plenty of liquid, keeps it cool, great colours, the top is easy on and off, as well as to carry by the D-handle. The only draw back on this water bottle is the fact that it initially leaks at the lid. After only a few times on and off with the lid, the rubber seal will develop memory and make the connection secure and leak proof. So when you see reviews giving low value because of leakage, it give it a few on and off with the lid, giving it a good tighten and after a bit the bottle will not leak. Saves having to return it. I give it a 5!", "Great value for the price! I've been using this for 2 months daily, both at home and at the gym, so it's bounced around my car and house and has not had any dents or chipping on the paint, it does not leak at all, and it came with the reach sponge so it can be cleaned easily. Super happy with this product, and the color looks great!", "Keeps your water cold for a very long time. Size is huge you will not run out of water whilst on the go. Value for money is reasonable. It is heavy in weight, the design is sleek and the quality is amazing."]}
