The quality is top notch. Very easy to clean, no leaks and keeps ice for a long time. Definitely worth every dollar. The silicone bottom was purchased separately but that's a must have. Easy to carry and functional. The design is better than all others on the market IMO.", "This water bottle is amazing. It is large and allows you to fill and drink all day. Keeps the water cold. I like the fact that it has a built in straw, and you don't have to tilted back to drink. But even if you want to tilt it back, you don't have to remove the straw, you can just tilt it back and drink like you would from a Regular bottle. The lid is tightly sealed and stays locked up.So you don't have to worry about unnecessary spills. There is also a lock in mechanism that will prevent it from them being opened while not in use.", "Owala makes fantastic bottles. The straw and pour options both work extremely well. The mouthpiece fits on your lip and is very comfortable. It’s very well insulated and keeps things hot or cold for a long period of time. would highly recommend this product.", "great size and design; easy to drink from and also to clean", "Love everything about it. Great for sipping, slurping or slamming your favorite beverage (I prefer water). Personally, I really like the integrated straw. Keeps water cold, I like the locking lid, and a great size for my cup holder.", "I absolutely loved this water bottle. Kept my water cold all day and it’s leak proof!", "So I purchased this on June 2nd, 2024, and it was working great. At the time, the handle seemed like it was very rigid and sturdy. Get to November 7th 2024. I’m holding the handle like I normally would from the handle, and I hear a crack. I come to find out the handle just cracked in half. No warning, no sign it was going to happen at all. No dropping the bottle, no hits to anything, only the bottom had dents on the bottom like everyone else, I’m assuming. There was no one time courtesy or anything to fix the issue. They will literally tell you to BUY a replacement. Stay far away when you see others having the same issues. You know it’s profits over everything when they are making bottoms you can purchase because everyone has dents on the bottom of their bottles. BOTTOM LINE: this has become a “Fashion Trend” product that doesn’t care about the quality and ruggedness of the bottles, just making them more stylish. Customer service is always pointing you to BUY more things from them and the so called warranty is a joke.", "Shipping took about a week. Product just as pictured and very functional.", "The Owala FreeSip is a game-changer! The dual sip feature is super convenient, and the insulation keeps drinks cold for hours—even on hot days. It’s lightweight, durable, and the handle makes it easy to carry around.It's also super easy to clean. Whether for the gym, work, or travel, this bottle does it all. Highly recommend!The only con I can think of is wont fit in some cupholders.", "Muy buena calidad, las bebidas duran mucho tiempo frías o calientes 10/10", "I’m really disappointed with my Owala water bottle. After just 30 days, the button broke, which I’ve now learned is a common issue. I was expecting better durability for the price. Unfortunately, I can’t claim a replacement directly from Owala because I purchased it through Amazon. I’d appreciate some assistance in resolving this as I still need a working bottle.", "Product exceeded my expectations.First heard about these from my wife, while initially hesitant, she convinced me and now can’t imagine going back!To build quality, design, ease of use and all of these micro decisions made to make this innovation to your daily water bottle. Your drinks stay cool practically all day, the built-in destroys of high-quality and provides great throughput (more than you’d expect) and surprisingly, maintaining the option to chug through their ingenious design.Plus! It never leaks and it really is odour free, so that note be sure to wash it regularly because you won’t have a smell to remind you!Ps. Definitely buy the boot. My wife didn’t when she initially bought hers and dropped it on some tiles. there’s no real dent, but there is a notable scuff/Imprint I will forever be a reminder that I am sometimes right"]}
