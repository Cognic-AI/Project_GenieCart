It has traveled extensively with me. The handle for carrying and the top that does not leak. Best water bottle ever. 10/10 recommend", "Love the colors, strap, and marks that let you know how much you’ve had. It's my favorite water bottle.", "It was REALLY hard to find a marked hydration bottle without the straw mechanism. Clearly most people love the straw but to me it's a pain to keep clean, and sometimes the straws just don't fit well over time. Plus I'm not a big fan of sucking in water thru a pipe bc I always suck in air too. I'd rather just pour it down my gullet. I looked long and hard and finally came across this beauty. The ease of drinking, the comfy design, the cute but not too cutesy encouragement on the side, the detachable cloth handle, and the filter all make it easy and fun to use. The filter is a game changer bc I'll cut up a strawberry or cucumber etc and enjoy water that actually has a hint of happiness to it! And I'm FINALLY hydrating enough.The bottle makes it easy to hydrate plenty -- actually I'm drinking more than this just from the bottle bc it's so inviting. Back here today to order another for a friend. One tip: If you use a bit of fruit in it, be sure to thoroughly wash/rinse it after or the flavor will carry thru to whatever you put in it next. So happy to have my new hydration buddy! Highly, highly recommend!", "It’s durable, easy to clean and use.", "I find myself drinking more water with a bottle like this. I can fill it up, put two crystal light packets in and can get water down. The design is good, it's a little wider then my car drink holder though. It still fits at the top of the drink holder, just doesn't go all the way in. ALso doesn't fit on the side of my backpack spot for water holder.Easy to just pop into the sink and clean. I have a brush\\straw cleaner combined and can easily take the straw out, and clean it with the straw cleaner. I also run the straw cleaner through the drink opening to clean that. Bottle brush does it's work and reaches to the bottom with no problems.Overall glad I purchased 6 of these!", "Love the blue color and the infusion part.  Did like how it was marked although can’t tell when the sleeve is on.  I was expecting the sleeve to assist in keeping water cooled, but even with ice (have used only indoors since I received it) does not stay cold very long.  Do like the ability to lock the lid on and easy to open.  Easy to hold especially with the strap no noted leakage and I’m sure if dropped by accident the rubber sleeve will help prevent it breaking or cracking.  This will help me in the gym or yoga workouts", "I bought my first one of these months ago, probably a year.  Now i own 6 of them for personal use, maybe i am just crazy lol.The reminder of top of day to drink is helpful, sadly i drink alot & no longer need the reminder.These cups are listed for 32oz, they have extra room to fit a full 1 liter = 33.8oz.Not sure this is helpful for anyone else but i learned 32 is the perfect amount of liquid intake in order to make me pee, good knowledge for road trips.I have tested this product, by that i mean i've used it, i've abused it, and it has endured.  I've dropped them indoors, outdoors, on concert, i have even thrown these bottles on several occasions.  By almost any standard they are highly endurable to be thrown around and dropped often.  Leak proof not fully but it is rare to get a leak, most recently i throw a bottle full of soda inside one of these bottles, carbonation & pressure did seep out creating a little mess, if it was water it would of probably done nothing.  There is a lock feature, i honestly have never used it & even dropping or throwing these bottle i never had the lid pop off or open, maybe i am just lucky.Anyways 2 for water, 2 for coffee, 2 for whatever, that includes alcohol and soda, you combine them it's a mixed drink lol.Extra note i once overfilled one of these bottles with water and left in the freezer, i thought the bottle was damaged because the ice made the bottom fold outwards, after it defrosted the bottle went back to it's original shape, no damage.  I was surprised.", "I love these and we have bought several and will buy more when the time comes. Only one suggestion, it would be great if the seller offered replacement lids.", "Es práctico pues di manejad no tienes que levantar la botella. En posición normal puedes beber el líquido din ningún obstáculo, lo amo.", "This product is perfect for prepping for colonoscopy or any time you have to measure what you drink at scheduled intervals.  Also helps to keep track of the amount of water you should be drinking daily.  Comes with strainer if you're adding fruits/vegetables, removable strap for outdoors, and padded cover for insulation and protection.  Love the colors!!", "Just what I was looking for.Measurement marks are clear and the cover is perfect to block light going through.I gave 5 ⭐️s to durability, because it look great, hopefully will last long.", "I like this water bottle."]}
