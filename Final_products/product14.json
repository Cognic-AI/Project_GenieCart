Having a night shade allergy it’s difficult to find options for a quick meal. Of course it’s not exactly like a tomato sauce but it’s similar. Most importantly it’s not a cream sauce or oily pesto.  It’s super healthy and the flavor is wonderful.", "verifiedPurchase": true}, {"reviewTitle": "That'll do, pig", "rating": 4, "reviewBody": "No, seriously. We tried. He has a nightshade sensitivity, and we tried to make a half a dozen different \"nomato\" sauces for spaghetti and lasagna. We gave up all hope until we found KC. It's not the same, but it works and tastes fabulous. A little caraway and oregano, and it tastes even better.", "verifiedPurchase": true}, {"reviewTitle": "ick", "rating": 1, "reviewBody": "I have had no mato sauce and this isn't it.

I would put the sweetness on par with Prego.<br/><br/>Still I will buy again", "verifiedPurchase": true}, {"reviewTitle": "Not for low acid diets!", "rating": 3, "reviewBody": "Read the fine print - the third ingredient is balsamic vinegar. While the taste was pretty good, it isn’t suitable for low acid protocols - which was what I bought it for.", "verifiedPurchase": true}, {"reviewTitle": "Great!", "rating": 5, "reviewBody": "This product is great! I can’t do tomatoes due to having IC - if you know what that is you know it’s a pain in the butt! I miss my acidic foods! Especially tomato products!! This works great in place of tomato sauce/paste like stuff. Been a game changer for me!", "verifiedPurchase": true}]}
