It is lower in acidity than many others (at least for me) and with a few fresh additions (garlic, onion, pepper flakes etc) its great.  Although its great on its own too!","The order was well packed, but a few cans were severely dented and others just a little dented. This may not bother some people, but it bothers me. The cans were not broke. The sauce itself is my favorite, thatâ€™s why I bought it.","I have been making Pasta Fagioli for years and lately I tried using this tomato sauce.  This is the best sauce I have ever used for this recipe.  My husband said it is recommended by chefs.  I can see why.","Whether I'm making pasta, pizza, or whatever, I start with Muir Glen's sauce. The quality is unmatched. I'm grateful to be able to get it in a 12-pack."]}
