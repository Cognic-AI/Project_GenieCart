Authentic Italian sausage taste. Perfect in all my Italian dishes. Great price here most of the time. So expensive on my grocery store shelf these days! :(", "This sauce is good with Spaghetti, Macaroni, Mac&cheese, and rice for tasty rich meals. Add in ground beef or meat balls as desired along with onions and peppers.", "Great products in general a good friend recommended a while back, great options to choose from flavorwise too, make sure to glance around for one that sounds good. Already down to two harsh after my last purchase. I also highly recommend. Lol contains tomato. I got multiple flavors, different sauces and one some how tasted like raw sausage but when I heated it up it actually seemed to cook. I've never had to doctor this brand before, but worth trying again", "Really good authentic Italian tasting pasta sauce for a quick meal without all the hassle of making from scratch.  Yummy!", "My 3 Jars arrived on time and in perfect condition, well wrapped in bubble wrap and in a sturdy box.\nThe flavor of Classico's Roasted Garlic Flavor Spaghetti Sauce, to me, tastes divine!! Besides receiving it today, I also had delicious Spaghetti tonight for my Supper!! Thank you to Classico and also to Amazon for creating and providing such a highly recommended product!! Will buy again and very pleased!!"]}
