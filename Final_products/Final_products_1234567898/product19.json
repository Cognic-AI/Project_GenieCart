With the boot (bought separately) it’s really hard to dent the bottle. I love that ice is still in my bottle when I wake up. I took the 24oz bottle in marshmallow color which fits in my cup holder in the car. I recommend, when washing your bottle, to take off the top part and let it dry before using again to avoid moisture to develop. Yes it’s a bit pricey, but it’s the best bottle I own out of the 10 I have.", "rating": 5, "reviewDate": "February 11, 2024"}, {"reviewTitle": "Great water bottle!", "reviewText": "I came across an article called \"Stanley's are overrated. Get this water bottle instead\". That link brought me to the Owala water bottle. I love how there is a chug spout plus an internal straw. There's no grabbing at a mouth piece with your hands. The internal straw is my favourite thing about this water bottle. The shape of the bottle is also comfortable to hold in your hand, even for people with petite hands. What I really appreciated about this water bottle was that there were little stickers (easy to remove and didn't leave sticky residue) on the parts of the lid to guide you how the cap works! I thought the stickers were cute and totally genius! Bottle and lid are easy to clean. I did order their specific cleaning brush but it hasn't arrived yet. My kids even are intrigued by this water bottle after purchasing their own Stanley's (\"it's trending right now\" was the answer to why they wanted Stanley's haha).  Extremely happy with this Owala purchase. It's helped me drink more water throughout the day as it keeps it nice and cold. It's also an adequate size. Not too big or small. Because it's leak proof when closed, you can throw it in your purse or bag without worrying about it spilling - can't do that with a Stanley! If you're looking for a reasonably priced water bottle with great function, absolutely get this one. Everyone in the family will be getting these as gifts this year!", "rating": 5, "reviewDate": "February 11, 2024"}]}
