I started looking for a new bottle and was surprised at the prices that were being asked. I found this bottle and decided to give it a try, and I haven't been disappointed.\n\nI bought one in the green color, and was happy to see that it had the same soft look as you see in their photos. The size if quite comfortable in my hand, and the texture makes if feel soft rather than plastic. The cap pops open with a quick thumb press, and yet when closed it seals quite well."}, {"review_title": "Nice size, convenient flip top!", "rating": 5.0, "review_date": "October 11, 2024", "review_text": "The material could be more resistant, but for the price, it's worth it."}, {"review_title": "fulfills its purpose (cost x benefit)", "rating": 4.0, "review_date": "October 11, 2024", "review_text": "The material could be more resistant, but for the price, it's worth it."}, {"review_title": "pretty sports bottle", "rating": 5.0, "review_date": "November 27, 2024", "review_text": "Some reviews mentioned that the recycling number is hard to see and it really does.
