The colors are so cute and the writing on the side help me track my water intake thru the day! I like that it's 1L cos it's light and easier to pack when full, compared to a 2L jug. Makes it so easy to get 2L in, just refill at 2pm each day (morning times on left label afternoon times on the right label).One key to prevent leaks tho, is to be sure the clear seal inside lid is tucked into lid well. If this seal gets off its track, it will leak.Also, there's a plastic tab on the lid you can flip up to prevent the lid from opening during travel."}, {"reviewer": "Tom Ato", "rating": 5.0, "title": "EXCELLENT bottle", "text": "No need to stop.

Not impressed with this bottle not spill proof as advertised. No warranty. I will stick with contigo as they have life time warranty. I'm very disappointed with this purchase.
