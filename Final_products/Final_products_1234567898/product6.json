The best I've ever had no question. I've been using my Starbucks bottle for years, and was hesitant to buy anything else. Because of how they've treated workers I didn't want to keep supporting Starbucks. This new water bottle blows it out of the water. The plastic sipping area is SO COMFY on my mouth.
