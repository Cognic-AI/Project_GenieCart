Such a cute design (although I can't speak for some of the others... lol), and the handle makes it very comfortable to carry. I love the straw and the fact that you can choose to sip or chug from it! It also keeps water cold for such a long time. Unfortunately, I've dented my bottle already by dropping it (about a metre drop), so it isn't the most dent-proof but you can always get a silicone boot to protect the bottom. After reading some reviews, I was worried that the bottle might come dented, but thankfully it was sent in a padded mailer and in great condition! My Owala literally comes everywhere with me now and I honestly can never go back to my other bottles. Although it may be a bit pricey, it is 100% worth the money as you'll get so much use out of it. Also reminder to take all the silicone bits out and wash them individually to keep everything clean! Definitely recommend this bottle if you haven't bought it already."}]}
