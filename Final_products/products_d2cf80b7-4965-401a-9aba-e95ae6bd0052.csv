My problem with Italian olive oils purchased here in the USA  is that producers are allowed to use olives and even olive oils from other countries and “finish” the production and bottling in Italy and then they are allowed to call it “Italian Olive Oil”.  The Greek oils are far less subject to that sort of adulteration.  This oil is 100% Greek origin and production, and it is dated.  Very transparent and I expect that.  I was exceptionally pleased with my purchase of the Théa Greek olive oil.  The light “grassiness” in the aroma is exactly what I experienced with all the Greek oils I tasted in Greece.  It has a balanced finish, not distinctly peppery, and I like that for many applications.
