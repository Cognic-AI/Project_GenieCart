Came in perfect condition, great price, sealed up and is exactly what I would buy at the store. The Simply is our fav because the ingredients are much cleaner than other types. Tastes great and we definitely need the larger perfect size for my ketchup fans! Love that itâ€™s lower in sugar and not too salty. Great size!"}]}
