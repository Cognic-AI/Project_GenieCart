The price is one-half of all stores in my area (Sierra Foothills).  I got so tired at seeing the high, high prices that I order most laundry soap, TP, rice, mayo, etc. thru Amazon.  Save a lot!", "date": "December 7, 2024"}, {"reviewer": "Russell Kurtz", "rating": 5.0, "review": "Until I bought this, I had seen two categories of choices for Heinz ketchup: large number of bottles (whether, for example, 12 bottles of 12 oz each or 12 bottles of 52 oz each) or three-packs. I always got the three-pack of 44 oz because it's the best size for me and the price was good. Now they have a two-pack, and the price per 44 oz bottle is only very slightly higher than the price in the three-pack. I don't have to store as many bottles in my pantry, which is relatively full already.\n\nThe only hesitancy I would have is that my two bottles seemed to be taken out of a three-pack (it said \"3 pack\" on the neck label). As long as the sell-by date is reasonable, that is not important to me, but it is interesting.", "date": "February 13, 2023"}]}
