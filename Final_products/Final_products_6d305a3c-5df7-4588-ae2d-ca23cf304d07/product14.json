They are huge and every single potato was in perfect shape and fresh. I will be back for more. I couldn't be happier.", "Could have been better. They appear to have been zapped to prevent spoilage. It is OK for food but not for planting in the back yard garden. Very poor quality. If I could have shipped them back at a reasonable price I would have but who wants to pay shipping back? I felt screwed by Amazon. Black spots throughout the potatoes. They were more than two years old. Total rip off in my experience.", "Bought these for making home made fries, and they are fantastic! I didn't have any of the problems that some of the reviews mention. None are bruised, rotted, or in pieces. Very moist on the insides when sliced, which I think indicates a fresh potato. These definitely bring my french fry hobby to a new level.", "Slow but they did make it right. Will order again when they have a new crop.", "Some rotten potatoes and some that were cut in half ... uneven in size ... I was rather disappointed ...", "they try to get it right but never there purchase for seed potatoes and they must have been sprayed with sprout in Helber the one that i did get never sprouted  I ask when the problem was going on but the never answered"]}
