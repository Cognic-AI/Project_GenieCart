To PLANT. There were several potatoes in the bag, but they had NO EYES & now it’s late August & I have tried EVERYTHING to get them to sprout but still not one eye! I even put them in compost& soil in a paper bag & gave a little water & waited a month! Still no eyes. They look like Costco “Tatos” I think they are pulling something. Go buy a bag of huge russets at Costco for $5 & sell them 5 at a time for $25? That’s about $150 profit a bag. Guess I shoulda ate them!", "Two absolutely massive potatoes. Bit pricey, but great size.", "I was mistaken when I ordered it. 5 lbs of potatoes are not many!", "Awesome!!! Love them! So fresh! They were still dirty, as if they pulled them from the grown and put them right in the bag!!", "There where chunks of uncooked potato.  The rest of the potato cooked okay.  Put it back to cook longer but didn't help.", "I asked  for  organic  potatoes  didn't  get them too many black stops had to be cut out very very dissatisfying"]}
