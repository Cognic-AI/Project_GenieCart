She carries it around the house like it‚Äôs a trophy, and I‚Äôm pretty sure her friends are now convinced we‚Äôre rolling in the dough.

What I really appreciated about this water bottle was that there were little stickers (easy to remove and didn\'t leave sticky residue) on the parts of the lid to guide you how the cap works! I thought the stickers were cute and totally genius! Bottle and lid are easy to clean. I did order their specific cleaning brush but it hasn\'t arrived yet.

Extremely happy with this Owala purchase. It\'s helped me drink more water throughout the day as it keeps it nice and cold. It\'s also an adequate size. Not too big or small. Because it\'s leak proof when closed, you can throw it in your purse or bag without worrying about it spilling - can\'t do that with a Stanley!
