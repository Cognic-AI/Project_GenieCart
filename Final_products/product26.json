I received mine in a oversized box that became ripped and torn up upon delivery and the Hammermill box tumbled inside. The Hammermill box had a single plastic strap over the lid to secure the 5 reams of paper. Fortunately, upon visual inspection that none of the 5 reams/packets were damaged. - Hammermill is one of the best paper producers in the industry. 97 Brightness is excellent and produces high quality text printing/image results.At times paper jams may occur, mostly with cheap All-in-One Printers that cost less then $300.However, paper jams can occur even with the best of printing/copier devices.I gave a rating of 4 Stars because the Hammermill packaging box did not have bundle-plastic straps in a crossover (Plus sign) to secure the ream printer paper packets as one strap is not enough. Also, a heavier interior liner is needed to protect the ream edges from being smashed/indented/crushed.", "rating": 4}]}
