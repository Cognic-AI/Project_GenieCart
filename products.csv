I can touch it, feel it, and even smell that fresh paper scent (don't judge me).\n\n- It's A4-sized, because who needs anything else? It's like the Goldilocks of paper sizes - just right.\n\n- The stack is so sturdy, I can almost use it as a paperweight (almost).\n\n- Perfect for writing, printing, doodling, or creating an epic paper fort (I did that).\n\nCons:\n\n- Ran out of product to write this review because I used all the paper.\n\n- Now I need to buy more, which is really an investment in my happiness.\n\n- May cause excessive paper airplane creation.\n\nIn conclusion, this A4 paper stack has exceeded my expectations. It's a game-changer, a life-changer, and a paper-changer. If you don't have one, what are you even doing with your life? Get yourself a stack (or three) and experience the pure joy of paper!\n\nP.S.
